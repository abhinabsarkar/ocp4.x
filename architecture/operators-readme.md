# Operators
An Operator extends Kubernetes to automate the management of the entire life cycle of a particular application. Operators serve as a packaging mechanism for distributing applications on Kubernetes, and they monitor, maintain, recover, and upgrade the software they deploy. The Operator Framework includes:
* Operator SDK: Enables developers to build operators based on their expertise without requiring knowledge of Kubernetes API complexities.
* Operator Lifecycle Management: Oversees installation, updates, and management of the lifecycle of all of the operators running across a Kubernetes cluster.
* Operator Metering: Enables usage reporting for operators that provide specialized services

Red Hat OpenShift uses Kubernetes operators to run the entire platform autonomously while exposing configuration natively through Kubernetes objects, allowing for quick installation and frequent, robust updates. 

Included in Red Hat OpenShift is the embedded OperatorHub, a registry of certified operators from software vendors and open source projects. Within the OperatorHub you can browse and install a library of operators that have been verified to work with Red Hat OpenShift and that have been packaged for easy lifecycle management.
