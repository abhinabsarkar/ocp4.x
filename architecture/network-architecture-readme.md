# OpenShift 4.x Network Architecture - Azure IPI (Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure)

> IPI or UPI doesn't make any difference with respect to the network architecture of OpenShift platform on the underlying cloud infrastructure 

The network architecture diagram is similar to the ARO (Azure RedHat OpenShift) solution - [link for details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift/concepts-networking)
